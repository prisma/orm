# multi-extension-monorepo

Worked example: a Prisma 8 application that depends on **two** internal contract-space packages — `audit` and `feature-flags` — plus its own application schema. Exercises the framework's per-space planner / runner / verifier with multiple extensions composed into a single application.

## What this demonstrates

Prisma 8's contract-space mechanism is symmetric across origin: a contract space contributed by an installed extension package, a published extension on npm, and an internal monorepo package all flow through the same descriptor surface. The framework reads each `extensions` entry's descriptor at authoring time, emits pinned per-space artefacts into the user's repo, and applies migrations from each space in cross-space order (extensions first, app last) inside a single transaction.

This example exercises that property end-to-end against PGlite (the embedded Postgres-compatible engine the framework uses for tests). Two trivial "internal extensions" each declare:

- a one-table contract,
- a single baseline migration that creates the table,
- a stable `<package>:create-<table>-v1` invariantId.

The aggregator (`app/`) declares its own `User` table and lists both internal extensions in its `prisma.config.ts`. After `migrate` + `apply`:

- pinned artefacts land at `migrations/audit/{contract.json,contract.d.ts,refs/head.json}` and `migrations/feature-flags/...`;
- migration directories at `migrations/audit/<dirName>/` and `migrations/feature-flags/<dirName>/`;
- the marker table has three rows (`app`, `audit`, `feature-flags`), each carrying the expected core hash and applied invariants.

The aggregate root at `app/prisma.config.ts` is the config an application author writes — the CLI reads it for `contract emit`, `migration plan`, `db init`, and `db update`. It imports the extension descriptors from `packages/*/src/control.ts` and lists them in `extensions`, exactly as a real application would import published extensions from npm.

This example is shipped as a single workspace package for ergonomic reasons (the framework's package layering treats `examples/*` as the top-level glob — see `pnpm-workspace.yaml`). The internal `packages/*` subdirectories play the role of separately-published packages in a real monorepo: each has its own descriptor module exporting an `SqlControlExtensionDescriptor` exactly as a published extension would. The framework code path is identical either way — the descriptor module is the only seam.

## Running

```sh
pnpm --filter multi-extension-monorepo test
```

## Authoring (maintainers)

Each internal "package" under `packages/` follows the **contract-space package layout** convention described in [ADR 212 — Contract spaces](../../docs/architecture%20docs/adrs/ADR%20212%20-%20Contract%20spaces.md). The same pipeline application authors use is applied per-subdirectory:

1. Edit `packages/<pkg>/src/contract.prisma` (the PSL entry-point — see the [contract-space package layout convention](../../.cursor/rules/contract-space-package-layout.mdc) for why PSL is the preferred authoring form).
2. Re-emit the canonical contract artefacts (`src/contract.json`, `src/contract.d.ts`) from inside the subdirectory:

   ```sh
   cd packages/<pkg>
   pnpm exec prisma contract emit
   ```

   `prisma.config.ts` in the subdirectory wires the emit pipeline to the contract source.
3. If the schema (or its set of typed objects) changed, scaffold a new migration directory:

   ```sh
   pnpm exec prisma migration plan --name <slug>
   ```

   Then hand-edit the generated `migrations/<dir>/migration.ts`'s `operations` getter so each op carries the package's stable `<pkg>:<change>-vN` `invariantId` (invariant IDs cannot be renamed once published). Re-emit `ops.json` + `migration.json`:

   ```sh
   node migrations/<dir>/migration.ts
   # or, on Node < 24:
   pnpm exec tsx migrations/<dir>/migration.ts
   ```

4. Update `migrations/refs/head.json` to point at the new contract `storageHash` plus the union of `providedInvariants` across all migrations.
5. The descriptor at `packages/<pkg>/src/control.ts` is **JSON-import wiring** over the on-disk artefacts; no manual edits are required for routine schema changes.

The `e2e.integration.test.ts` consumes both descriptors through their public `contractSpace` surface — pulling `{contractJson, migrations, headRef}` directly — so the only thing the test depends on at the source level are `src/constants.ts` (for `<PKG>_SPACE_ID`, table names, etc.) and `src/control.ts` (the descriptor itself).
