## `cursor-rejects-expression-orders`

`db.orm.<ns>.<Model>....cursor(...)` builds its keyset from plain model columns. It throws `ORM.ARGUMENT_INVALID`, naming the 1-based `orderBy` position, when an active order is any of these:

- an extension-operation result, such as `(p) => p.embedding.cosineDistance(v).asc()` or `(m) => m.text.fullTextRank(q).desc()`;
- a relation field, such as `(p) => p.author.name.asc()`;
- a relation count, such as `(u) => u.posts.count().desc()`;
- an order with null placement, such as `(p) => p.title.asc({ nulls: 'last' })`.

The check runs when `cursor()` is called and again when the query is planned, so an order added after `cursor()` is refused too. Before this change an extension-operation order was left out of the keyset without an error, which returned wrong pages.

For each `.cursor(` call on a `db.orm` chain that also calls `.orderBy(`, look at every `orderBy` lambda in the chain. If any of them is one of the orders above, do one of these:

- Paginate with `.limit(n).offset(n)` and remove `.cursor(...)`:

  ```ts
  const page = await db.orm.public.Post
    .orderBy((p) => p.embedding.cosineDistance(v).asc())
    .limit(20)
    .offset(pageIndex * 20)
    .all();
  ```

- Keep the cursor and order by plain columns only, for example `(p) => p.createdAt.desc()` and `(p) => p.id.desc()`.

`distinctOn()` throws the same error when one of the first N orders, where N is the number of `distinctOn` columns, is not a plain column: Postgres needs those leading orders to match the `DISTINCT ON` columns, so such a query already failed in the database; it now fails earlier, with `ORM.ARGUMENT_INVALID`. Put the `distinctOn` columns first; a relation order, a count or an operation result may follow them. For example, `.orderBy([(post) => post.title.asc(), (post) => post.author.name.asc()]).distinctOn('title')` is accepted.
