    summary: |
      `defineContract` now applies the MongoDB polymorphism rules that PSL applied. It refuses a discriminator that is optional, a list or not text, such as an `Int32` field (`CONTRACT.ARGUMENT_INVALID`); a variant value the discriminator field cannot hold or that is not a member of its enum; a variant listed in `discriminator.variants` that no model declares with that base; a variant stored in another collection than its base (`CONTRACT.COLLECTION_INVALID`); and, in TypeScript and PSL, a variant field stored under a name a field of its base is stored under, such as the discriminator (`CONTRACT.NAME_DUPLICATE`, `PSL_DUPLICATE_STORED_NAME`), which would overwrite that field; and, in TypeScript and PSL, a variant field that restates a base field with a different stored name, type, nullability or list shape (`CONTRACT.ARGUMENT_INVALID`, `PSL_VARIANT_FIELD_DIFFERS_FROM_BASE`), whose documents the collection's validator, written from the base, would refuse. Make the discriminator a required `field.string()` or a string enum, list only declared variants, leave a variant's `collection` out or set it to its base's, give each variant field a stored name its base does not use, and restate a base field on a variant exactly as the base declares it, or not at all.

  - id: mongo-index-shape-rules
    summary: |
      Every MongoDB contract source now refuses an index MongoDB would refuse (`CONTRACT.INDEX_INVALID` in TypeScript, `PSL_INVALID_INDEX` in PSL): a unique wildcard index, a wildcard with a hashed, 2d or 2dsphere key, a hashed index on several fields, a TTL wildcard index, a wildcard projection without a wildcard key, a collation without a locale, and a second text index in one collection. PSL also refuses an index that another model on the same collection, or the same model, already declares, such as `@unique` and `@@unique` on one field. Remove the index or change it to a shape MongoDB accepts; remove a duplicate.

    summary: |
      `defineContract` now refuses a value object field typed by an enum the contract does not declare (`CONTRACT.ENUM_UNKNOWN`), as it already did for a model field. Add the enum to `defineContract({ enums })`.
  - id: mongo-newly-accepted
    summary: |
      No action is needed. An optional field that a type alias, `@onCreate(...)`/`@onUpdate(...)` or `.onCreate(...)`/`.onUpdate(...)` fills is now accepted, as on SQL; a list that generates a value is still refused. A TypeScript variant may leave its `collection` out and is stored in its base's.
  - id: mongo-prisma6-merged-indexes
    summary: |
      A Prisma 6 schema read by `prisma6Schema()` in which one collection holds two identical indexes, such as `@unique` and `@@unique` on one field, or the same `@@index` on two models stored in one collection, now gives one index, as the database holds one. That contract's storage hash changes. Run `prisma contract emit`, then `prisma db sign` to record the new hash; the database itself needs no change.

# MongoDB contract sources share one builder

Every MongoDB contract source, `defineContract`, Prisma 8 PSL and the Prisma 6 reader, now builds through one builder, so each MongoDB rule applies to every source in the same way. The changes below are where a source now refuses or accepts what it did not before. A contract that every source accepted before builds to the same `contract.json`.

## `mongo-ts-polymorphism-rules`

The detection matches a file that imports the MongoDB contract builder and declares a discriminator; an emitted `contract.d.ts` imports no builder, so it is not matched.

A discriminator must be a required text field, and each variant must be declared and stored in its base's collection:

```typescript
const Task = model('Task', {
  collection: 'tasks',
  fields: { _id: field.objectId(), type: field.string() },
  discriminator: { field: 'type', variants: { Bug: { value: 'bug' } } },
});
const Bug = model('Bug', { base: Task, fields: { severity: field.int32() } });
```

## `mongo-index-shape-rules`

MongoDB refuses these indexes when it creates them, so the contract now refuses them first. A matched file uses a wildcard, a hashed key, a wildcard projection or a collation; check each such index against the list in the summary.

## `mongo-value-object-enum-check`

Declare every enum a value object field uses in `defineContract({ enums })`.

## `mongo-newly-accepted`

Nothing to change.

## `mongo-prisma6-merged-indexes`

Emit the contract again and sign the database, so `db verify` compares against the new storage hash.
