      The domain half of an emitted SQL contract now carries the type parameters and enum value sets the schema declares: on fields typed by a named type, on enum list fields, and on composite type members. In `contract.d.ts`, a composite type member with type parameters now has the parameterized output type. Re-emit the contract. The storage half, every hash and migration snapshots are unchanged.

## `domain-types-match-their-columns`

Run `prisma contract emit`. `contract.json` and `contract.d.ts` gain these entries in the domain half:

| PSL | Added to the field's domain entry |
| --- | --- |
| `code Short`, with `types { Short = VarChar(10) }` (also `Short[]`) | `"typeParams": { "length": 10 }` on `type` |
| `roles Role[]`, where `Role` is an `enum` | `"valueSet": { "plane": "domain", "entityKind": "enum", "namespaceId": "public", "entityName": "Role" }`, as `role Role` already had |
| composite type member `amount Numeric(10, 2)` (also a list, or a named type) | `"typeParams": { "precision": 10, "scale": 2 }` on `type` |
| composite type member `role Role` or `roles Role[]` | the same `valueSet` as a model field of that enum |

A named type without parameters, such as `Email = String`, adds nothing.

In `contract.d.ts`, a composite type's output type (`AddressOutput`) now gives a member with type parameters the parameterized output type a model field of that type has, such as `Varchar<10>` or `Numeric<10, 2>`, instead of the codec's plain output type. These are branded strings, so code that builds such an output object from plain strings, such as a test fixture or a mock, no longer type-checks. Build the value as the ORM returns it, or type it with the composite type's input type (`AddressInput`), which is unchanged.

Migration snapshots under `migrations/snapshots/<hash>/` need no change. Migration commands read only their storage half, which is unchanged.

`prisma contract print` now expects a field typed by a parameterized named type, and an enum list field, to carry these domain entries. It refuses a contract emitted before this change that lacks them. Re-emit it first.

## `value-object-default-matches-composite-type`

A literal default on a field typed by a composite type used to be stored whatever its shape. It is now checked, and a mismatch is `PSL_DEFAULT_TYPE_INCOMPATIBLE`, naming the path that is wrong:

- a single value object takes a JSON object and a list of them a JSON array: `` homes Address[] @default(json`{"street": "x"}`) `` is refused; write `@default([])` or `` @default(json`[{"street": "x"}]`) ``;
- a key that is not a member is refused, and so is a missing member that is not optional;
- each member's value must be a value of the member's type, as its own `@default` would be: `"street": 1` on `street String` is refused;
- nested value objects are checked the same way.

Correct the value the diagnostic names.

## `composite-type-attributes-refused`

An attribute inside a `type` block was ignored: `street String @default("x")` stored no default, and `@@map` mapped nothing. Each is now refused, `PSL_UNSUPPORTED_FIELD_ATTRIBUTE` on a member and `PSL_UNSUPPORTED_COMPOSITE_TYPE_ATTRIBUTE` on the type. Remove the attribute. To give a value object a default, write it on the model field as a whole value, such as `` home Address @default(json`{"street": "x"}`) ``.
