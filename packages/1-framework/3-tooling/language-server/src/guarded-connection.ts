/**
 * Wraps a connection so that an outbound call the client is no longer there to
 * receive does nothing, instead of throwing at whoever made it.
 *
 * `vscode-jsonrpc` marks the connection closed the moment the input stream
 * ends, and every send after that throws synchronously. A throw that escapes a
 * notification handler ends the process: jsonrpc reports it through its logger,
 * which is the connection's own remote console, so the report is another send —
 * it throws again inside a `.catch()`, and the unhandled rejection is fatal.
 *
 * The wrapper carries the check so no individual send site has to: reads walk
 * the connection's features (`console`, `languages`, …) and hand back guarded
 * functions, so a send added later is guarded by construction. Only the
 * connection's departure is swallowed — any other synchronous failure is a bug
 * in the caller and still reaches it.
